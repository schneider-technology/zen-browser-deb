# zen-browser-deb
!! DON'T USE AS OF NOW !!

For some reason it only works right after the install - I'll have to investigate further on why and how that can even happen

TODO: remove more unneeded files?

TODO: uninstaller script. The desktop file should be removed from /usr/share/applications, the rest seems to be handled.

It's my first time build a Debian package, so be careful! I've only tested this in a VM, not confident enough yet to use it on a machine I'm actively using.

Creates a debian package for zen-browser based on the tarball

Use it/fork it/do whatever you want :) I'm happy for suggestions/improvements. Put the tarball into the root directory of the project and execute the script to build the package.
