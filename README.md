# zen-browser-deb

It's my first time build a Debian package, so be careful! Been using it as of now for ~2 months without any issues.

Creates a debian package for zen-browser based on the Appimage. I first tried using the tarball, but couldn't find a way to disable the automatic installer which don't really make sense for Debian packages.

Use it/fork it/do whatever you want :) I'm happy for suggestions/improvements. Put the tarball into the root directory of the project and execute the script to build the package.
