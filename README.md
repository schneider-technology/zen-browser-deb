# zen-browser-deb
!!Doesn't work properly!!

The main issue is, that the built in updater can destroy existing installations. So it would probably the best to either compile it from scratch (without the updater).


It's my first time build a Debian package, so be careful! I've only tested this in a VM, not confident enough yet to use it on a machine I'm actively using.

Creates a debian package for zen-browser based on the tarball

Use it/fork it/do whatever you want :) I'm happy for suggestions/improvements. Put the tarball into the root directory of the project and execute the script to build the package.
