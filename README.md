# zen-browser-deb

It's my first time build a Debian package, so be careful! I've only tested this in a VM, not confident enough yet to use it on a machine I'm actively using.

Creates a debian package for zen-browser based on the tarball

Use it/fork it/do whatever you want :) I'm happy for suggestions/improvements. Put the tarball into the root directory of the project and execute the script to build the package.
